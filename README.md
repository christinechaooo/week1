### Week 1 - Basic views and layout

![Demo] (/week1.gif?raw=true "Demo")

Took 7 hours to complete.

####Completed features
- Implement the page programatically without using Interface Builder
- Move the textfield when the keyboard appears
- Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable (though the link doesn't go anywhere)
- Add UILabels with attributed text
- Add a UITextField (I used labels instead of a background image)
- Add UIImageViews
- Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.
- Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.
